Technical Experience

:  **C#:** Couple of years of professional app development targeting .Net Framework. In free time I'm closely following
  evolution of .Net Core, .Net Standard and ASP.Net Core. Huge fan of SignalR, BenchmarkDotNet and Xamarin Android/iOS (less of Xamarin Forms). Weird hobby: studying CoreFX sources.

:  **Typescript:**  My current project is all things Typescript, besides that I've also done contributions to several Visual Studio Code extensions that are mostly written in TS.

:  Some knowledge of **F#** and **Scala**, good with **Python**
